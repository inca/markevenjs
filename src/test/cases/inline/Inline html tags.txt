In inline markup tags like
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/syntax.html">these</a>
are emitted verbatim.

Self-closing tags <input /> are supported.

If something looks like tag, but does not have > at the end,
it's not rendered as tag, e.g <a

All non-tag uses of < character should be properly escaped. <3

Ah, also, tags inside code spans like `<a>` are escaped.
